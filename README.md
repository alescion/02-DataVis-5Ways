# R + ggplot2

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

Since I had never used R before, it took me a decent amount of time just to figure out how to run a script... eventually I found good documentation and everything worked out!

# d3...

D3 is a JavaScript library for visualizing data with HTML, SVG, and CSS.

The challenge here was finding a way to make everything actually appear in the location I wanted things to be (my circles kept rendering off the screen). Margins helped me tremendously with solving that issue. I also included some code to hide n/a values.
